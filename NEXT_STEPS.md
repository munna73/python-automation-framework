# Next Steps for Framework Testing

## What to Test:
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. `behave --dry-run` (check BDD structure)
3. `behave --tags=@smoke` (run smoke tests)
4. `python scripts/run.py --help` (test CLI)
5. MongoDB connectivity tests

## If Issues Found:
- Note specific error messages
- Include command that failed
- Share relevant log files
- Mention which component (MongoDB, API, MQ, BDD)

## Framework Features to Mention:
- 100+ files created
- MongoDB connector with aggregation support
- Enhanced BDD step definitions
- Tag-based test execution
- CLI with database commands
- Export utilities with CLOB handling
